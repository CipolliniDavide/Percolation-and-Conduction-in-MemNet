# Basic use of the code
To see a basic implementation of the memristive network with Ohmic impurities look to 
`scripts_Opt/showcase_script.py
`
# Remake of paper results
To create the data and some of the images in the paper run
`create_data_analysis.sh
`
# Setting env
Code developed in  `Python 3.10.12`
To install requirements use:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
